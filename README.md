# Master_Thesis
These codes are added for master thesis appendix. They can be used in option pricing under stochastic interest rate.

The code 'bootstrapping' enables to convert yield curve rates to zero coupon rates

The code 'CRR_BDT_model' generates a binomial tree by combining the CRR and BDT models and its outputs are risk neutral probabilities and interest rates of the tree.

The code 'option_pricing' calculates the option prices for different strike prices and maturities by using the output of the code 'CRR_BDT_model'.
